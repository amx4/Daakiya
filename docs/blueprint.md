- Accent color: Soft purple (#9575CD) for highlighting interactive elements and call-to-action buttons.
- Body and headline font: 'Inter' (sans-serif) for a modern and clean look, suitable for both headers and body text.
- Use simple, outline-style icons for representing actions and data types, ensuring clarity and scannability.

- Subtle animations (e.g., progress bar or spinner) to indicate loading states.
